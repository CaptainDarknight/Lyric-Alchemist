Lyric Alchemist blends **emotion and logic** — reimagining how we experience music by representing lyrics through **formulas, chemical elements, and equations**.

### Example
| Original Lyric | Converted Output |
|----------------|------------------|
| “You are my oxygen” | “U R my O₂” |
| “Our love is infinite” | “Our ❤️ = ∞” |
| “We bonded forever” | “We → Covalent Bond ∞” |

It’s a new way to feel music — where **art meets science**, and **emotion becomes equation**.
